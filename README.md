# My Learnings in AI/ML


A repository of notebooks and python experiences based off of my progress and cumulative projects of an online AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp. I wanted to elaborate on the theoretical concepts through real-world projects and applied intelligence that revolve around, data analysis.


## Projects in Data & AI


The repository maintains some basic, but still largely enhanced notebooks and code exercises that cover:


- Data analysis using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib  
- Applied ML and AI fundamentals


## Notebooks


- `Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb`: my first steps in data analysis using pandas.  
- `Introduction-to-Numpy.ipynb`: different array manipulation and operations.  
- `Introduction to Matplotlib.ipynb`: data visualization and time series plots.  


*The notebooks represent my own personal learning path and directly reflect the lectures of the AI & ML Bootcamp (Udemy).  
Please feel free to explore, fork, and suggest improvements!*
