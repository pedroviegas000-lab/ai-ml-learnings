# My Learnings in AI/ML

Repository with notebooks and Python experiments based on my progress in an online AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp.  
The goal is to consolidate theoretical concepts through practical projects focused on data analysis and applied intelligence.

## Projects in Data & AI

This repository includes annotated notebooks and code exercises covering:

- Data analysis with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib  
- Applied Machine Learning and AI foundations

## Notebooks

- `Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb`: first steps in data analysis using pandas.  
- `Introduction-to-Numpy.ipynb`: basic operations and array manipulation with NumPy.  
- `Introduction to Matplotlib.ipynb`: data visualization and time series plots.  

*All notebooks are part of my personal learning path and follow the structure of the AI & ML Bootcamp (Udemy).*  
Feel free to explore, fork, and suggest improvements!
